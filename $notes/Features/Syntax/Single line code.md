It should be simple to write code on a single line.

This means:
## 1. No tab / whitespace dependence
The language should be completely independent of how many tabs / spaces / carriage returns are used between statements, only that they are used.
## 2. Simple line combination
There should be an easy way to combine the effects of multiple lines into a singular line.
